# Maxime's Portfolio

This portfolio will contain all of my labs done in Interactive Multimedia Programming course in Oulu UAS (OAMK).
It can be used for students who need to list their labs/exercises and document them, as a diary.

This **README** will be completed later.

All of this repository is free to use, share, modify and republished only for educational purpose. 
This product is provided "as is" and only the final developer/user is responsible of the graphic user interface and its behavior.
